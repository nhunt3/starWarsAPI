I made 2 slightly different versions of the program. one pulls pages synchronously, the other asynchronously. I made the code a bit quicker than I would have liked to and didn't have time to refactor much, like I normally would. Hopefully it's not too bad though.

To get started, run:
```
npm i
node asyncPages.js getResidents
```

To run the other, synchronous one, just run:
```
node asyncPages.js getResidents
```

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
