I made 2 slightly different versions of the program. One pulls pages synchronously, the other asynchronously.

To get started, run:
```
npm i
node asyncPages.js getResidents
```

To run the other, synchronous one, just run:
```
node syncPages.js getResidents
```

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
